class constructor: def __init__(self, id=None)::
if id is not None, assign the public instance attribute id
with this argument value - you can assume id is an integer

Add static method def to_json_string(list_dictionaries):
that returns the JSON string representation of list_dictionaries.
Add class method def save_to_file(cls, list_objs):
that writes the JSON string representation of list_objs to a file.
Add static method def from_json_string(json_string):
that returns the list of the JSON string representation json_string:
Add class method def create(cls, **dictionary):
that returns an instance with all attributes already set:
Add class method def load_from_file(cls): that returns a list of instances:
Add the class methods def save_to_file_csv(cls, list_objs):
and def load_from_file_csv(cls): that serializes and deserializes in CSV:
Has the same behavior as the JSON serialization/deserialization
Format of the CSV:
    Rectangle: <id>,<width>,<height>,<x>,<y>
    Square: <id>,<size>,<x>,<y>
Add the static method def draw(list_rectangles, list_squares):
that opens a window and draws all the Rectangles and Squares:
